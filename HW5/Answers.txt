Q3:
The biggest advantage of the new scheme is that same operation collision, which
may happen in EliminationArray where push() or pop() may exchange with another
push() or pop() respectively. But this scheme wastes a lot of memory as previous
slots are not reused, and arrays keep growing with more stack operations. In
addition, the exchange scheme is highly dependent on the number of history
history operations. It can only have a high parallelism when both numbers of
previous push() and pop() operations are similar; otherwise, it's hard for them
to meet at the same slots. In a word, EliminationArray has more parallelism
along with a good range policy.
